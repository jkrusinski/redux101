# Redux 101

### What is Redux?

> *"Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps."* \- [Redux Documentation](http://redux.js.org/)

Before we can figure out what the above definition tells us, we first need to understand another important conceptâ€”state. When we talk about state in an application, we are talking about all of the variables (or more specifically locations in memory) that can change in value over *time*. A stateful application is designed to remember preceding events or user interactions and behave respectively. While this may seem like a simple concept, you may know that managing state is a source of frustration for many developers. This is because changing state is inherently an asynchronous process, which as you know is a difficult concept to represent in code. On top of having to visualize how your application changes over time, many different parts of your code may depend upon or even manipulate the same piece of state. Separating or even repeating this logic across your code provides an abundance of opportunity for bugs to appear as the project develops. By now you might be thinking to yourself, why don't we design our application so that all of the logic concerning state is organized in one central location? Well in fact, that is exactly the purpose of Redux.

Since the same pieces of state are depended upon by many different parts of our application, it makes since to organize our application so that all of the logic concerned with state is contained in one place. Redux is a framework designed to do just that.
